1. *Overview*
This app fetches news articles based on selected categories (Bitcoin, Technology, Sports, Business, Health) from the NewsAPI and displays them in a user-friendly interface. Users can bookmark articles for later reference. The app allows users to switch between categories and view updated articles accordingly. Bookmarked articles are saved locally using AsyncStorage for offline access.

2. *How to Use*

*Category Selection:*
At the top of the app, a dropdown (Picker) allows users to select a news category.
Available categories include Bitcoin, Technology, Sports, Business, and Health.
Once a category is selected, the app fetches news articles related to that category.
Viewing Articles:

Articles are displayed in a scrollable list, with each article showing the title, description, publication date, and an image (if available).
Each article is clickable, opening the full article in a browser via the articleâ€™s URL.

*Bookmarking Articles:*

Articles can be bookmarked by pressing the "Bookmark" button. Bookmarked articles are stored locally on the device and can be accessed later.
Users can toggle bookmarks (add or remove) by pressing the button again.

*Offline Bookmarks:*

Bookmarked articles are saved locally using AsyncStorage. Even if the app is closed, users can retrieve their bookmarked articles when they return to the app.
